# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask 

## Web Scraping
Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:
*	Job title
*	Salary Estimate
*	Job Description
*	Rating
*	Company 
*	Location
*	Company Headquarters 
*	Company Size
*	Company Founded Date
*	Type of Ownership 
*	Industry
*	Sector
*	Revenue
*	Competitors 

## Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

*	Parsed numeric data out of salary 
*	Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages 
*	Removed rows without salary 
*	Parsed rating out of company text 
*	Made a new column for company state 
*	Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters 
*	Transformed founded date into age of company 
*	Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
* Python  
* R  
* Excel  
* AWS  
* Spark 
* Column for simplified job title and Seniority 
* Column for description lengt

## EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.
